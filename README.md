# Timer
A modified version of a simple countdown timer from https://www.udacity.com/blog/2021/09/create-a-timer-in-python-step-by-step-guide.html 
- added winsounds, and ability to repeat without relauncing the console app.

This was made with credit going mostly to udacity - I have just done some slight modifications to the code to make it fit my 
uses case.

Feel free to use and modify if you come across this.

Timer v1.0 - Plays winsound when timer is done.

Timer v1.1 - Plays ringtone.wav when done.
